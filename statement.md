# C# Tutorial - Part 1: Intro

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a high-level general-purpose compiled object-oriented programming languaged developed by Microsoft, with default libraries now managed under the .NET Foundation.

What does all that mean?
* C# can create all sorts of programs: Games, websites, servers, apps, databases, you name it! The code for almost anything that isn't an operating system or driver can be written entirely in C# (although even some projects find a way!). 
* C# is "compiled", meaning that another program (known as a compiler) takes the code that you can read, and changes it into a form the computer can read. This is different than an "interpreted" language like Python or JavaScript, which is are scripts that the computer reads the text the moment you run them. 
* C# uses the concept of "objects". We see objects in real life all the time, like the screen you may be reading this on. But computers don't understand what an "object" is. Luckily, we programmers can create our own objects, and have the computer pretend they exist. It makes it easier for us to make them interact with each other in programs, and for us to organize them.
* C# uses the ".NET" libraries in its most core functionality. If you've ever used a higher-level programming language, you find out pretty quickly that you don't make the computer do everything! You instead ask the computer to do something, and if you are allowed to do it, you can! .NET gives you all the things you need to make C# work on any modern operating system (not just Windows, like in the good old days)!

# World's Smallest C# Programâ„¢

Here is the smallest C# program possible. We shall be expanding this ever-so-slowly over time. Before long, you can create the next big thing on your own! (Legal note: The next big thing is in limited supply, and cannot be guarenteed to every customer)
```C# runnable
static void Main() {}
```
